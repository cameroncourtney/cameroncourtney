This is a rough outline for the Project 0 Linux Shell Assignment.
I have created a skeleton of how I believe my partner and I should
create our structs, tokenize input, and execute commands. Since
the actual project codebase is more expansive than this single file
I have created, the code I have created is not yet complete. When
my partner and I begin, we can start to fill in the gaps. This is
just a starting point I have created to help us get a better 
understanding of the assignemnt.
